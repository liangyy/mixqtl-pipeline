Run `mixqtl` on simulated data generated by `../single/`

The config file is quite simple and it is generated by `submit.sh` on the fly 

Example run:

```
$ bash submit.sh /scratch/t.cri.yliang/mixqtl-pipeline-results/simulation-single/ __readcount.{m}.rds /scratch/t.cri.yliang/mixqtl-pipeline-results/simulation-mixqtl
```
